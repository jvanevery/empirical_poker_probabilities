Empirical Poker Hand Probability Generator 

Jordan VanEvery ~ Last Modified: 2017-3-2 

The program determines the probability of improving a five card poker hand when allowed to discard a single card from the hand and replace it with a remaining card in the deck. An empirical method is used (for educational purposes, it would be much faster to compute theoretical probabilities) in which we run the experiment of replacing a card with remaining cards in the deck many times to generate probabilities. The precision of the probabilities is determined to an arbitrarily chosen precision. 

Example input/output: IN: 2D 2C 5H 2H 2S  --->  OUT: 2D 2C 5H 2H 2S >>> Four of a Kind 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
